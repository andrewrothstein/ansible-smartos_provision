0.2-Current
This playbook now requires python to be installed on the SmartOS hypervisor. This allows much more flexibility and easier module support.

To setup python on your SmartOS hypervisor, set `hypervisor_install_python` to `true`. This can be set in your playbook and will skip if python is already installed.
